# ReWrite
ReWrite is a project developed in CSE 403: Software Engineering at the University of Washington. 

## Overview
The goal of this website is to make things like complex scientific research papers more easily understandable for the average person. We provide an intuitive UI, giving the user the ability to input a URL to a paper. We then use the ChatGPT API alongside some prompt engineering in order to procure an organized summary of the input paper.
