Progress: Added more stylistic design to the frontend translate page as well as including a new select translation type so that users can choose between a quick summarization or a more indepth version.

Long-Term Goal: Include a new progression tracker on the translate page when users click the translate button. That way, the users are aware that the summarization is in process.

    - Progress Update: Full deployment of the website onto a server using Vultr. Experimented with various possibilities for hosting such as Render.com and Netlify.com, but wound up creating a full server using Vultr.com. Deployed a development version and then also finally got a working production version. The project is now available from our new [website](http://45.77.208.169/).
