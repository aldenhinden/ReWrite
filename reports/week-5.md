# Status Report
Week 5 status report

## Team Report
### Front-End
Progress: Implemented the foundation for Angular and finished desigining the header for all the webpages.

Long-Term Goal: Design and implement all webpages so that individuals can begin interacting with each

Responsibiltiy: John Li

### Back-End:
Progress: Initial progress on webscraping PDFs, research started for ChatGPT integration and database schema. 

Long-Term Goal: Complete full webscraping implementation and integrate with front-end so users may upload PDFs for scraping. Implement ChatGPT integration to allow for communication between ChatGPT and Node.js server.

Responsibility: Alden, Yusuf

## Contributions
1. John Li
    - Progress Update: Set up the foundation for Angular and finished implementing the navigation bar for all the webpages so that users can visit the Home, Translation and Link Key page. Learned that making the website pretty is currently too difficult and should implement the barebone skeleton so that individuals can begin working. Currently am stuck on understanding the Components and routing on Angular.

    - Last Week's Goals:
        - Set up Angular for Git repo ✔️
        - Implement navigation bar ✔️


    - This Week's Goals:
        - Implement barebone skeleton of the Home and Translation page (ETA: 7 days)
        - Begin researching on how to save cookies (ETA: 1-2 days)
        - Improve styling on the webpages (ETA: N/A)


2. Alden Hinden
    - Progress Update: Began sample implementations of webscraping services, experimenting with JavaScript and made some progress learning how to use the Node.js library, specifically integrating Express.js and pdf-parse in order to implement basic PDF webscraping. Learned that full website webscraping will be potentially too difficult to implement quickly enough, and we will probably stick to simple PDF uploads for scraping. 

    - Last Week's Goals:
        - Decide the bounds and framework for webscraping ✔️
        - Begin basic PDF webscraping ✔️

    - This Week's Goals
        - Full implementation of PDF webscraping using Express, Node.js and its libraries such as pdf-parse (ETA: 3 days)


3. Yusuf Farah
    - Progress Update: Began research for ChatGPT integration with Java Spring, but transitioned to integration with Node.js as the project tech stack was changed. Also began review of database schema design and good practices when creating a database and storing data. 

    - Last Week's Goals:
        - Research ChatGPT integration with Java (accomplished in Node.js instead) ✔️
        - Review of MySQL and database schema design ✔️

    - This Week's Goals:
        - Finish integration of ChatGPT API with Node.js server
        - Create rough draft of database schema


4. Ben Ihrig
    - Progress Update:
        -Played around with getting simplified/summarized text from ChatGPT to get a sense for how things will go, read up on tips/tricks for how to get good performance out of GPT3.5

    - Last Week's Goals:
        - Prompt engineering research ✔️

    - This Week's Goals
        - Compile testing suite of 10 research papers and 10 complex blog posts
        - Write js code to run the tests by calling GPT
