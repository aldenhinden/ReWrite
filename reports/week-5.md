    - Progress Update: Set up the foundation for Angular and finished implementing the navigation bar for all the webpages so that users can visit the Home, Translation and Link Key page. Learned that making the website pretty is currently too difficult and should implement the barebone skeleton so that individuals can begin working. Currently am stuck on understanding the Components and routing on Angular.
