## Contributions
1. John Li
    - Progress Update: Set up the foundation for Angular and finished implementing the navigation bar for all the webpages so that users can visit the Home, Translation and Link Key page. Learned that making the website pretty is currently too difficult and should implement the barebone skeleton so that individuals can begin working. Currently am stuck on understanding the Components and routing on Angular.

    - Last Week's Goals:
        - Set up Angular for Git repo ✔️
        - Implement navigation bar ✔️


    - This Week's Goals:
        - Implement barebone skeleton of the Home and Translation page (ETA: 7 days)
        - Begin researching on how to save cookies (ETA: 1-2 days)
        - Improve styling on the webpages (ETA: N/A)


2. Alden Hinden
    - Progress Update: Began sample implementations of webscraping services, experimenting with JavaScript and made some progress learning how to use the Node.js library, specifically integrating Express.js and pdf-parse in order to implement basic PDF webscraping. Learned that full website webscraping will be potentially too difficult to implement quickly enough, and we will probably stick to simple PDF uploads for scraping. 

    - Last Week's Goals:
        - Decide the bounds and framework for webscraping ✔️
        - Begin basic PDF webscraping ✔️

    - This Week's Goals
        - Full implementation of PDF webscraping using Express, Node.js and its libraries such as pdf-parse (ETA: 3 days)
