 
The question of whether a lion is stronger than a cat can be answered by comparing their physical features and musculature. Lions have a broader build, more muscular structure and are better suited for overpowering prey, such as large mammals. Cats on the other hand, have smaller, lithe bodies which are better suited for ambushing prey. They are not as strong as lions and lack the powerful muscles needed to take down large prey.
